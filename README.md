Hi! I'm currently involved in active research on optimizing NN based classfiiers for Medical Decision Support for Coronary Artery Disease. Also working on a regression
model based on extracted features for comparison with CFD model of CAD. My previous ventures involve CV based realtime detectors integrated and deployed with hardware as
a need based solution. I've been experimenting with other domains also including automation scripts and Data Mining, scraping, cleaning, augmentation and visualization. 
I'll be sharing my works in my repository with an aim to seek input of experts and improvement in algorithms.
Looking forward to a healthy intellectual input from experts here.
